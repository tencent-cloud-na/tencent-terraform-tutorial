#Introduction to Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

There are many quick introductions to Infrastructure as code(**IaC**) with Terraform. Instead of repeating the content here, you can review [this quick introduction](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code?in=terraform/gcp-get-started). 

Also, I have prepared a slide deck to introduce IaC and Terraform [here](./Terraform-Quick-Start.pdf). There may be some terminologies or concepts which are too much for you at this point in this slide deck. But, don't worry! You should be able to understand them once you finish this whole tutorial.
