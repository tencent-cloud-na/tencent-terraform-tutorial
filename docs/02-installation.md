# Install Terraform

It is straightforward to install Terraform. It mainly involves downlowding of Terraform binary and moving it into your system's PATH directory. You can also use installation tools, such as yum or apt-get on Linux, Homrebew on OSX, or Chocolatey on Windows. Please follow the corresponding instruction for your own environment [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/gcp-get-started).

You can run `terraform -version` or `terraform -help` on your command line console to verify your installation.
