# Next Steps

This concludes the getting started tutorials for Terraform with Tencent Cloud. Hopefully you're now able to not only see what Terraform is useful for, but you're also able to put this knowledge to use to improve building your own infrastructure.

For more hands-on experience with the Terraform configuration language, or to learn more of the building blocks of Terraform, review the tutorials below.

[Configuration Language](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/configuration-language) - Get more familiar with variables, outputs, dependencies, meta-arguments, and other language features to write more sophisticated Terraform configurations.

[Modules](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module) - Organize and re-use Terraform configuration with modules.

[Provision](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/provision) - Use Packer or Cloud-init to automatically provision SSH keys and a web server onto a Linux VM created by Terraform in AWS.

[Import](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/state-import) - Import existing infrastructure into Terraform.

Also, please keep monitoring the progress of our [Tencent Cloud out-of-box modules](https://github.com/terraform-tencentcloud-modules/terraform-tencentcloud-modules/tree/dev). These modules can help you build your infrastructure faster.
